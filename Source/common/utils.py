# common utility functions used by this application
#
# Function email_is_valid validator uses Regular Expressions language, importing
# library for this below called re. This library built in Python no need to install.
# In regex language, ^ $ are begin end, means analyse whole string which user inputs.
# [] means any number characters I think
# [\w-] means any number characters including hyphen, which is excluded otherwise for some
# reason. @ means @. \. means . as this needs to be escaped. () means repeat any number of times.
# QED from above '^[\w-]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w]+$' regex string
# gives a proper email format. NB will_crox@hu.ie.dh-hye.?:OPEE%$Â£.feg.com for example
# would be accepted here, but no need to be any more pedantic than this!
