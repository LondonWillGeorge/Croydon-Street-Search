    <h3>Technical Details of Application</h3>

    <p style="font-size:18px">This is a demonstration application (no commercial use as is) using Python 3 with the
    Flask web application library, MongoDB, and Bootstrap with Jinja2 HTML template engine for Python, Flask and Jinja2
        being modelled on Django templates, and is hosted on CentOS 7 Linux on a Digital Ocean droplet, served with nginx and uWSGI.
    It uses the publicly available Croydon Highways Register 2015 version from a public website address, and a second
    Mongo 'collection' (originally a table in SQL-based MS Access). This second collection contains data on the Split
    Road, Split Borough and TfL side road status of the roads which have this in Croydon, but where a street does have
    a TfL side road, this data is currently mostly missing the TfL side road name (eg "A23").</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px">I have attempted to produce RESTful API type URLs (webpage addresses) for the street list and street report pages, by adding a separate
    consecutive numbered id field to the Mongo data, and passing this in the street report URL. Conversely, the street list URL contains the
    actual search terms entered by the user. In this way, unique street list or street report searches have their own
    unique, reasonably short and hopefully reasonably clear URL</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px">I used PyCharm for coding and debugging this app. Please email me any questions:

    <h3>The Land Charges Search Process related to this Application</h3>
    <p style="font-size:18px">This is a part of the CON29 section of the Land Charges search process for people considering
    a property purchase in the UK. The CON29 form is a standard national form in the UK, produced by the Law Society, and
    almost everyone who buys a property will first get a CON29 search done by their solicitor. Other information not available yet
    includes environmental notices recorded against properties, local listed building statuses and more.</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px"> If it could be scaled and used practically, it would also need to integrate geospatial data, making it a complex
    and large project, perhaps using a link to the Ordnance Survey API, and storing this data in GeoJSON format which
    Mongo supports.</p>

    <h3>History of this Application so far</h3>
    <p style="font-size:18px">I originally wrote this as an MS Access application (.MDB file) using VBA code after finishing a data entry temp
    position in Croydon council, then learnt Python 3 and Mongo shell to put it online. My Access version is also really
    a demo app, since in practice a large block of VBA code is an unnecessary maintenance risk/cost in this organisation.
    Because of virus risks, nobody would dare open a .mdb file sent by email, which is another reason I rewrote it for
    online demo!</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px">Obviously, this is a small application which would be fine to use a SQL database such as Postgre or MySQL, but
    since I had used SQL already in the Access app, and to demo potential scalablity and gain experience of a highly
    scalable database, I used Mongo in this application.</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px">At present, it is missing user login functionality, which time permitting, may add in future, storing the user
    emails and PBKDF2-SHA512 double-hashed passwords in a separate Users collection in the database. The Street Lists
    and Street Reports buttons, unused at present, could show lists of each user's saved lists or reports, and a demo function to enter and save
        'dummy' streets in the database may also be helpful.</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px">To begin learning Python 3, I followed most of "Learn Python the Hard Way" ebook online, followed by a Udemy course,
    https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-web-course-learn-by-building-8-apps by Jose Salvatierra. Then got much more
    Python 3 experience by writing this. Also solved a "medium" rank problem on one of the live challenges on Hacker Rank
        in Python 2, which works for 9 of 11 test inputs. (This problem is
        <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/code-and-the-curious/challenges/sell-statistics-query-system/problem" style="color:#00C300">here</a>.
        My solution is <a href="/../Hacker_Solution.jinja2" style="color:#00C300">here</a>, which can be pasted and validated in the problem page.)</p>

    <h3>"Box C Streets" Meaning in this Application</h3>
    <p style="font-size:18px">In the Land Charges search process, the property buyer's solicitor may want to check status information for one or
    more side streets to the street where the property is addressed. For example, if the property is on or near a road
    junction, or if the back garden of a property abuts a busy street etc. then knowing whether or not this back road
    is a TfL maintained road or private road etc. could possibly affect a purchasing decision or property value.</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px">These side streets are called "Box C" streets on the standard CON29 form.</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px">In practice, perhaps much of this whole process has an 'insurance' value for the buyer; in most cases this data may not matter much
    to the average buyer or affect the property value much, but the total cost of a land charges search is usually low
    compared to the price of even a small property purchase.</p>
