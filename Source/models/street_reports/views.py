# maybe simplest try passing variables in url_for in Jinja template separated by ,
# which gets them all appended as queries to the URL, if we need to make the URL unique to the queries?

# check Jose chair application how to return exit function, (break is for loops only) and handle errors?

# Show previous streetlist and streetreport selections as lines on these pages, iterated from the collection,
# maybe need implement user login to do this, or can we do with just a session variable for now?

# And a trial method to insert new street on homepage? Message to tell people try and find your new street here?
